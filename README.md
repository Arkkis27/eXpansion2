# eXpansion² Prototype

This is a quickly done prototype for eXpansion² using symfony components. 

**This is not meant to be used as it is !**

## TODO

- [ ] Remove unused symfony components (used full stack to get something fast)
- [ ] Separate into 3 repositories
    - Application for installation 
    - Core for the core
    - base plugins
- [ ] Handle all the missing stuff such as gamemode change....
